Rusults:
1. Machine Learning Model 1:

-Balanced Accuracy Score: 95%
-Precision [0]: 100%
-Precision [1]: 86%
-Recall Score [0]: 1.0
-Recall Score [1] : 0.91

2. Machine Learning Model 2:
-Balanced Accuracy Score: 99%
-Precision [0]: 100%
-Precision [1]: 85%
-Recall Score [0]: 0.99
-Recall Score [1]: 0.99

Conclusion:
In conclusion, I would recommend the second machine learning model 
because of the increased balanced accuracy score in comparsion with
the second machine learning model. While both works fine, the second 
one has a better precision/accuracy, in addition to the high recall scores.
When looking at credit risk, the company is especially worried about 
incorrect outcomes, it is important to identify the consumers.
